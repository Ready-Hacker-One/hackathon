## Introduction
### Why SKALE at the Hackathon?

SKALE empowers Ethereum DApps to scale solidity smart contracts in a secure, reliable, cost-effective manner. In shortâ€Šâ€”â€Šwith minimial changes you can deploy your dApp to an Elastic sidechain with flexible configurations, 1 second blocktimes, and no gas limit. These features are great IRL, but they are also great at hackathons where the added performance and features helps you show off improved UX and new features unavailable to other blockchain systems.
